VES Library is opensourced library provided for Virtual Event Streaming Agent
development.

The VES Library provides standard API for Data collector agents
to interface with DCAE. This VES Library supports 5.x version of API.
   The Vendor related documentation is provided in
         https://github.com/att/evel-test-collector/tree/master/docs/att_interface_definition
   VES preliminary documentation is under
         https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/ves/VES+Home


To compile C Library
   C compiler would be needed for Linux and Windows.

  Ubuntu platform dependencies are
              sudo apt-get install update
              sudo apt-get install upgrade
              sudo apt-get install build-essential
  For Redhat/CentOS it would be
              sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"

  Compile:
              cd veslibrary/ves_clibrary/evel/evel-library/bldjobs;make clean;make all
  Install VES Library:
              cd veslibrary/ves_clibrary/evel/evel-library/bldjobs;make install

For Running the VES Agent
      pthread, curl and libcurl3 packages will neeed to be installed
    Sample agents Firewall (vFW) and Loadbalancer (vLB) are provided as development examples
    Modify per your agent requirements
     Reporting DCAE/VES collector ip and port also need to be setup


To compile Java library

  On Windows
   Load the Maven project into Eclipse
    Select evel_javalib2 project Right click
      Select Maven > Download Sources 
      Select Maven > Update Project
   then
    Select pom.xml Right click > Run As > Maven Clean
    Select pom.xml Right click > Run As > Maven Build
   to compile and build the jar

  On Ubuntu platform dependencies are
   sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
   sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

  Maven build utility
   sudo apt-get install mvn

  On Redhat/Centos
   sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
   sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

  Maven
   sudo yum install maven2

  Compile library:
   cd  veslibrary/ves_javalibrary/evel_javalib2;mvn clean install


  Copy the evel_javalib2-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar into directory

  Dependent classpath jars that are needed to compile and Run
   log4j-1.2.17.jar
   javax.json-api-1.1.jar
   slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar
   slf4j-log4j12-1.7.5.jar
   javax.json-1.0.4.jar

  Sample Agent application is at src_test/maindir/Main.java
     mkdir ./evel_javalibrary/att/com/maindir
     copy the agent code into this directory and modify per your agent requirements
     Reporting DCAE/VES collector ip and port also need to be setup


  Compile Sample VES agent
   javac -cp <.:dependent jars> ./evel_javalibrary/att/com/maindir
  Run VES agent
   java -cp <.:dependent jars> evel_javalibrary.att.com.maindir.Main
